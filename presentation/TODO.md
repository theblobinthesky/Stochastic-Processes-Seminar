- Make the presentation look nicer, first. Improve the theme. Incorporate the uni-passau-logo.png.
- Then transfer the writeup into this presentation. Obviously we cannot keep everything, as this has to be about 40 minutes long.
    You should transfer the following concepts:
    Definition 1
    Remark 1
    Remark 2
    Example 1
    Example 2
    Definition 2
    Remark 3
    Example 3
    Theorem 1
    Theorem 2
    Theorem 3
    Theorem 4
    Corollary 1
    Remark 5
    Theorem 5
    Theorem 6 (no proof)
    Theorem 7
    Definition 4
    Theorem 8
    Example 5

    And all relevant figures

- Do not use any animations. Static slides. They can look nice, but don't make them reveal slowly.
- Strictly copy information. Do not change the formatting or notation and fix no mistakes! Purely copy and make it look good and ergonomical. Keep the order the same.
- Split theorems with multiple items into separate slides, so if possible figure, statement and proof are on the same slide or at least close to each other.
