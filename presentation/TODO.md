- Make the presentation look nicer, first. Improve the theme. Incorporate the uni-passau-logo.png.
- Then transfer the writeup into this presentation. Obviously we cannot keep everything, as this has to be about 40 minutes long.
    You should transfer the following concepts:
    Definition 1
    Remark 1
    Remark 2
    Example 1
    Example 2 (spilling out of the page)
    Definition 2
    Remark 3 (delete image)
    Example 3
    Theorem 1
    Theorem 2 (make image larger; only prove (1) as an example; the rest are boring)
    Theorem 3 (only prove (1); the rest are too much)
    Theorem 4 (no proofs; relatively boring!)
    Corollary 1
    Remark 5 (delete Question 1, 3, 4, 5)
    Theorem 5 (state theorems on slide with individual questions; proof comes right after the q slide)
    Theorem 6 (no proof)
    Theorem 7 (delete part 2 and proof 2)
    Definition 4 (delete all)
    Theorem 8 (delete all)
    Example 5 (delete cross entropy mention; minimizing relative entropy is enough)

    And all relevant figures

- Do not use any animations. Static slides. They can look nice, but don't make them reveal slowly.
- Strictly copy information. Do not change the formatting or notation and fix no mistakes! Purely copy and make it look good and ergonomical. Keep the order the same.
- Split theorems with multiple items into separate slides, so if possible figure, statement and proof are on the same slide or at least close to each other.
- These i guess chapter slides don't show any text.
- Remove citations from presentation; Only necessary in writeup
- Make Definitions more compact for the presentation
